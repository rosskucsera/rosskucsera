      <h1 class="fade-in fade-first">Expensify Usability Exercise</h1>
      <h3 class="case-study-title">Overview</h3>
      <p class="overview">I chose to rework a single interaction within a web app called Expensify used to track company expenses. I thought there was an opportunity improve how Expensify gives you feedback as you are going through this process.</p>
      <div class="case-study-details fade-in fade-second">
        <div>
          <h3 class="case-study-title">Problem</h3>
          <p class="case-study-description">When I use Expensify I am generally switching back and forth between different browser tabs to download various receipts for uploading that it's easy to lose track of what row you were working on last.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="case-study-title">Solution</h3>
          <p class="case-study-description">I created a new section below the main list of expenses to visually separate the two. Now instead of hunting around for the small receipt icon to see if that receipt is ready to submit, the distinction is made more clear.</p>
        </div>   
        <div>
          <h3 class="case-study-title">Skills used</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Research</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="img-with-caption fade-in fade-second">
      <img src="../imgs/expensify-basic.png"/>
      <p class="caption">What I always nd frustrating is that it's not easy to visually see which expenses are done and which ones I still need to add a receipt for.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="img-with-caption fade-in fade-second">
      <img src="../imgs/expensify-current.png"/>
    </div>
    <div class="img-with-caption fade-in fade-second">
      <img src="../imgs/expensify-proposed.png"/>
      <p class="caption">I created a new section below the main list of expenses to visually separate the two. Now instead of hunting around for the small receipt icon to see if that receipt is ready to submit, the distinction is made more clear.</p>
    </div> 
    <div class="img-with-caption fade-in fade-second">
      <img src="../imgs/expensify-proposed2.png"/>
      <p class="caption">There's something satisfying about seeing the expense move down to the 'Ready to submit' section. While a simple enough change (it could be as easy as adding a new CSS class to the row element when a receipt is added to it), it actually adds a bit of excitement to the mundane task of expense management.</p>
