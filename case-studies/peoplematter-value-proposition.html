      <h1 class="fade-in fade-first">PeopleMatter Value Proposition</h1>
      <h3 class="case-study-title">Overview</h3>
      <p class="description">The product marketing and sales teams wanted to develop a set of sales collateral that highlighted the value of PeopleMatter products versus going heavy on features. Along with sales presentations and printed collateral, the Results Page as it came to be known described in detail PeopleMatter's five main value propositions.</p>
      <div class="case-study-details fade-in fade-second">
        <div>
          <h3 class="case-study-title">Problem</h3>
          <p class="case-study-description">All website content at this time was heavily feature-focused. Sales team gave the feedback that while features are important, they ended up getting into &quot;feature battles&quot; with competitors. To help the sales team, collateral and webpages needed to be created to help differentiate PeopleMatter.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="case-study-title">Solution</h3>
          <p class="case-study-description">Created a page that could be used by website visitors as well as sales team members during presentations to easily explain the company&#39;s value proposition.</p>

    <div class="img-with-caption fade-in fade-second">
      <img src="../imgs/value-proposition-sub-nav.png"/>
      <p class="caption">Our sales team planned to use this page while on calls with prospects. To help them navigate the page easier and act almost like slides in a presentation, we made the arrow keys jump to each section.</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="img-with-caption">
      <img src="../imgs/value-proposition-slider.png"/>
      <p class="caption">Previously the individual blocks within this slider were stacked on top of one another alternating the photo on the left and the right (like a lot of websites). However, on this page we realized it quickly got very long and was hard to keep track of what "result" you were actually looking at. This slider layout let us group things based on the result we were highlighting.</p>

      <p class="caption">This was one of the original sketches for the value propositions page based of our pattern library. I think we did pretty well!</p>
