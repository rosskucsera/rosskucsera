      <h3 class="case-study-title">Overview</h3>
      <p class="description">The PeopleMatter Institute (PMI), PeopleMatter&#39;s thought leadership division, creates content in the form of webinars, infographics, reports and white papers. These assets are promoted through email campaigns and social media but are also available through the corporate website.</p>
      <div class="case-study-details fade-in fade-second">
        <div>
          <h3 class="case-study-title">Problem</h3>
          <p class="case-study-description">The number of assets from PMI grew significantly, but searching to find the one you wanted was next to impossible. You needed to have a direct link to the one you wanted. A new webinar initiative also required us to allow someone to register for a webinar directly from the page without going to a third party site.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="case-study-title">Solution</h3>
          <p class="case-study-description">Created a central repository that makes it easy to filter and select a specific resource based on type or topic. Created various resource page types depending on whether pre-registration was required.</p>

      <p class="caption">I'd seen similar sorting menus like this around the web while researching the changes we wanted to make to the resource center. We had well over 50 assets that we wanted users to be able to find easily or discover someting they didn't know we had.</p>
