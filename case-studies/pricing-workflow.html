      <h3 class="case-study-title">Overview</h3>
      <p class="overview">PeopleMatter investigated and pursued a &quot;self-start&quot; sales process whereby a user could sign up, pay for and begin using the product entirely on their own. The pricing page project aimed to turn the corporate website into the sales team to handle the credit card transaction for a new customer signing up as well as the provisioning of a new customer.</p>

          <h3 class="case-study-title">Problem</h3>
          <p class="case-study-description">All new business is closed using sales and implementation teams. A large segment in the smaller end of the market is left untouched because it is not cost-effective to puruse.</p>

          <h3 class="case-study-title">Solution</h3>
          <p class="case-study-description">Created a simple workflow that customers of various sizes can use to educate themselves about the product, self-select the tier that&#39;s right for them, purchase and complete the setup process. </p>
