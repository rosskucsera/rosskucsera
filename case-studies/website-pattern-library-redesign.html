      <h1 class="fade-in fade-first">Website Pattern Library & 2014 Redesign</h1>
      <h3 class="case-study-title">Overview</h3>
      <p class="overview">The corporate website at PeopleMatter has gone through three major revisions since 2010. This redesign was a chance to put in a solid foundation for more rapid and consistent development in the future.</p>
      <div class="case-study-details fade-in fade-second">
        <div>
          <h3 class="case-study-title">Problem</h3>
          <p class="case-study-description">Current website structure is based on a non-modular framework causing development time to suffer significantly. Website design and branding do not match updated product marketing printed and digital collateral.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="case-study-title">Solution</h3>
          <p class="case-study-description">Developed first pattern library for the corporate website to speed up prototyping and final building of new pages. Restructure information architecture on site to match offline assets.</p>
        </div>   
        <div>
          <h3 class="case-study-title">Skills used</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Planning/Wireframing</li>
            <li>Design</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS</li>
            <li>Project management</li>

    <div class="img-with-caption fade-in fade-second">
      <img src="../imgs/pattern-library-redesign-whiteboard.jpg"/>
      <p class="caption">Working with our Director of Product Marketing and Senior Copywriter we developed a set of "blocks" that we wanted to use across the new website. I filled up the whiteboards next to our desks with sketches before I ever opened up Photoshop. The content would change depending on the page it was one, but the overall structure needed to remain the same for consitency and speed of building pages.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="img-with-caption">
      <img src="../imgs/pattern-library-redesign-block-types.jpg"/>
      <p class="caption">After sketching out the various block types we knew we needed to build each page type I created high-fidelity prototypes in Photoshops. This is just a sample of the block types I sent to our web developers to build.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="img-with-caption">
      <img src="../imgs/pattern-library-redesign-layers.jpg"/>
      <p class="caption">And this is what my layers palette looked like when I was done. Organization and folders within folders was crucial to make handing this off to our developers easier. Although, I would not necessarily choose Photoshop to do this type of work in the future, it was what I was used to at the time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="img-with-caption">
      <img src="../imgs/pattern-library-redesign-paper.jpg"/>
      <p class="caption">Once we had the 8-10 basic block types defined we actually printed and cut them out would assemble pages on conference room tables reordering the various strips until we thought we had the perfect flow of content.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="img-with-caption">
      <img src="../imgs/pattern-library-panel-content.jpg"/>
      <p class="caption">This was essentially the digital version of the printed out strips of paper. While I didn't build or design this (it's just the editing screen in Drupal for a page) I thought it was still worth documenting just how easy pages were to assemble after the pattern library was established.</p>
