      <h1 class="fade-in fade-first">Website Pattern Library & 2014 Redesign</h1>
      <h3 class="case-study-title">Overview</h3>
      <p class="overview">The corporate website at PeopleMatter has gone through three major revisions since 2010. This redesign was a chance to put in a solid foundation for more rapid and consistent development in the future.</p>
      <div class="case-study-details fade-in fade-second">
        <div>
          <h3 class="case-study-title">Problem</h3>
          <p class="case-study-description">Current website structure is based on a non-modular framework causing development time to suffer significantly. Website design and branding do not match updated product marketing printed and digital collateral.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="case-study-title">Solution</h3>
          <p class="case-study-description">Developed first pattern library for the corporate website to speed up prototyping and final building of new pages. Restructure information architecture on site to match offline assets. </p>

      <p class="caption">Once we had the 8-10 basic block types defined we actually printed and cut them out would assemble pages on conference room tables reordering the various strips until we thought we had the perfect flow of content.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="img-with-caption">
      <img src="../imgs/pattern-library-panel-content.jpg"/>
      <p class="caption">This was essentially the digital version of the printed out strips of paper. While I didn't build or design this (it's just the editing screen in Drupal for a page) I thought it was still worth documenting just how easy pages were to assemble after the pattern library was established.</p>
