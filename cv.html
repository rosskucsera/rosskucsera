			<p>Since 2010 I've been on the Marketing team at PeopleMatter, a provider of online employee hiring, training and scheduling software based in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
      <p>I started as a graphic designer about a year after the company was founded and initially worked on graphics and assets for email campaigns.</p> 
      <p>I took charge of the corporate website at the end of 2011 and have been in charge of the design and managing the development of it since then.</p>
