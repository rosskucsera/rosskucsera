			<p>I am passionate about creating effective and efficient design work across multiple mediums.</p>
			<p>I follow the iterative design process. When approaching new projects I first try to understand how my design expertise can help solve the problem at hand. This thought process has been essential at PeopleMatter where I am the the sole designer for web, UI, print, presentation and video communications. I thrive when I can take project all the way from initial idea to final product.</p>
			<p>My formal training is in graphic communications and print production. Over the past four years I have expanded my design knowledge to include UI, web and presentation design.</p>
