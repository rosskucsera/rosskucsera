			<p>My name is Ross and I'm a designer currently in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
      <p>I'm interested in creating effective and efficient design work across web, UI, or print mediums.</p>
			<p>When approaching new projects, I first try to understand how my design expertise can help solve the problem at hand.</p>
      <p>I follow the iterative design process and thrive when I'm working with a team taking a project all the way from initial idea to final product.</p>
			<p>My formal training is in graphic communications and print production, but over the past four years and a half years I have focused on UI and web design and learning core front end technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
