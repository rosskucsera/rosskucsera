          <h1 class="margin-top">Hi, InVision!</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="note">
          <p class="margin-top">Iâ€™m Ross, a T-shaped designer with experience across all aspects of the design process,
            from idea through implementation, and I would love to offer my skills and experience to join the InVision
            team as Senior Product Designer.</p>
          <p class="margin-top">Over the past eight years Iâ€™ve worked on design teams ranging from a pair of us at a
            tech startup to a group of dozens at an international financial institution. Working in these diverse
            environments has given me a unique perspective on designing the best user experiences to suit different
            customers in distinct settings and taught me the value of across-the-board collaboration.</p>
          <p class="margin-top">Pursuing the Senior Product Designer position at InVision particularly appeals to me as
            I admire InVisionâ€™s goal of empowering design teams of all sizes. I have a similar passion for helping scale
            design thinking, and in my current role at Standard Life, I have helped initiate the companyâ€™s first design
            system. This created a consistent design language across a variety of platforms and made collaborating with
            engineering colleagues more efficient when implementing new products and features.</p>
          <p class="margin-top">Additionally, I believe a designerâ€™s role goes beyond the visual, which is why I am
            motivated by seeing the paths real users take to achieve goals and then testing ways to improve their
            experience. At Standard Life, to show stakeholders exactly how users interact with our products, I
            introduced a session recording and analytics tool. This addition to the UX teamâ€™s toolbox has given us more
            qualitative and real-time insights with which to make user-centric design decisions.</p>
          <p class="margin-top">As a designer with an approach to design that aligns with InVisionâ€™s, this opportunity
            would be an exciting match for my skills and interests. Please explore my website to see samples of my work
            and the thought process behind some of my designs. Creating the site has been a fun way to showcase my work
            and design thinking while getting to experiment with the latest HTML and CSS specs that I donâ€™t always get
            to use in my day job.</p>
          <p class="margin-top">I look forward to hearing from you soon,</p>
