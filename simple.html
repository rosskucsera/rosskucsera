          <h1 class="margin-top">Hi, Simple Thread!</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="note">
          <p class="margin-top">Iâ€™m Ross, a T-shaped designer with experience across all aspects of the design process,
            from idea through implementation, and I would love to offer my design and front-end development skills to
            join the Simple Thread team as a UI/UX Designer.</p>

          <p class="margin-top">Pursuing this opportunity with Simple Thread excites me as I find your methodical
            process for approaching new projects reflects my priority for asking questions before building solutions. In
            my work as a designer over the past eight years, I regularly collaborate with other designers, developers
            and product owners to understand business and user needs, conduct user tests and scope out project
            requirements before moving to designing and iterating on prototypes.</p>

          <p class="margin-top">Joining the Simple Thread team would allow me to contribute my extensive experience
            designing and building responsive web layouts and developing component-based design libraries to help
            increase efficiency and consistency. For instance, in my current role at Standard Life I helped initiate the
            companyâ€™s first atomic design system of reusable components. This created a consistent design language
            across a variety of platforms and made collaborating with engineering colleagues more efficient when
            implementing new products and features.</p>

          <p class="margin-top">My professional work has allowed me to become proficient in conducting user and
            usability research, crafting UX flows and mastering design tools including Sketch, Zeplin and InVision. I am
            motivated by seeing the paths real users take to achieve goals and then testing ways to improve their
            experience, which led me to introduce a session recording and analytics tool at Standard Life to give the UX
            team more qualitative and real-time insights with which to make user-centric design decisions. Iâ€™m also
            comfortable wading into the codebase alongside developers and have gained experience in the React
            development environment to create clickable HTML- and CSS-based prototypes and using git to contribute code
            to the production environment.</p>

          <p class="margin-top">I invite you to explore my website to see samples of my work and the thought process
            behind some of my designs. Creating the site has been a fun way to showcase my work and design thinking
            while getting to experiment with the latest HTML and CSS specs that I donâ€™t always get to use in my day job.
          </p>

          <p class="margin-top">As a self-motivated designer with a user-focused approach to design that aligns with
            Simple Threadâ€™s (and a similar love for hyphens), this opportunity would be an exciting match for my skills
            and interests. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>

          <p class="margin-top">Cheers,</p>
