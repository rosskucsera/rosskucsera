        <h1 class="title">Journey design for digital retirement advice</h1>
        <p class="subtitle padding-top">Prior to this online retirement advice and planning service being launched,
          Standard Life only offered financial advice to wealthier customers, leaving the majority of customers without
          access good financial advice at a crucial point of their lives: retirement.</p>

      <section class="grid grid__40-40-20 max-width border-radius color-white background-opaque padding-all">
        <div class="padding-right-x2">
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p class="smaller">Long-term customers of Standard Life, a UK-based pension provider, were transferring their
            money from Standard Life when they were at the point of retirement. Not only was this a negative for the
            business losing customers, but in most cases customers were not aware of the important tax considerations
            that could make a massive difference in how long their money lasted in retirement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="padding-right-x2">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p class="smaller">Designed, tested and iterated on an end-to-end journey allowing customers to say what types
            of money they had and when they wanted to retire and were presented with the most tax-efficient income
            number they could expect to achieve in retiremet.</p>

            <li>User research</li>
            <li>Usability testing</li>

        <div class="text-item">
          <h2>The user journey we had</h2>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">We started with a journey that made customers click 6 times (!) before they ever
            started
            entering any data — let alone get any valuable information from the service. We also had a massive drop off
            rate — 90% — in the third step by forcing customers to login
            right away.</p>

        <div class="text-item">
          <h2>The user journey we deserved</h2>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">The focus of the "after" journey which we dubbed "Quick Start" was to let the
            customer get started right from the landing
            page, get value back as soon as possible and remove pain points that could cause them to drop out.</p>

        <div class="text-item">
          <h2>Landing page</h2>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">By asking just for their current age to get started, we were attempting to
            remove any hesitation about giving this tool a try.</p>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">We wanted to imply that this was a simple process that would give them real
            value in under 10 minutes and wasn't going to take long.</p>

        <div class="text-item">
          <h2>Value exchange</h2>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">We realized from testing that many people had no idea how much they could expect
            to receive from their state pension (social security) that would make up the foundation for many customers'
            retirement income. This was an easy thing for us to add that provided real value on the second page of the
            journey.</p>

        <div class="text-item">
          <h2>Big touch targets, simplified layout</h2>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">Earlier designs we had for these pages where users selected the types of
            accounts had two major problems that came out in usability testing with our target users who were 55–65:</p>
          <ol class="margin-top margin-left-x2 smaller">
            <li>Sizes of the select buttons made it hard to select with a mouse because of the precision required to hit the target</li>
            <li>We asked for an exact value of their account causing unneccessary back and forth between the
              keyboard and mouse (many users were not touch typers so actually had to look down from the screen to the keyboard</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">I thought that grouping all the answers a user could give using only a mouse and then all the answers that required keyboard entry would help keep the user focused and keep the journey feeling quick and simple.</p>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">Session recordings and future usability testing proved my assumption correct with no users struggling to click on items or having to look up and down from the screen.</p>

          <h2>A little bit of context makes a big difference</h2>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">Prior to "Quick Start" we asked customers their current age and the age they wanted to retire before they were allowed to start the journey.</p>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">We noticed a lot of users weren't sure when they wanted to retire and just wanted to use this tool to get an idea of what retirement could look like for them.</p>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">By placing this question here, right before the big reveal of their potential income in retirement, helped put the age in context and helped push users to select a more realistic number.</p>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">Since we knew their current age, we simply defaulted the retirement age to their age +1 year and allowed them to use that or change it.</p>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">Clicking 'Estimate my income' then triggered the <a class="smaller" href="css-animation-loader.html">spinner component</a> I helped code and implement to provide further context to what exactly was happening behind the scenes.</p>

          <h2>Let's break this down…</h2>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">The level of financial literacy varied widely among our users and we were starting to introduce a lot concepts all at once like assets, incomes, regular incomes, pre-tax, post-tax, money left over.</p>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">The information hierarchy was tricky to get right, but we got to a good place by starting with one big number — the income — and relating all other numbers to it.</p>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">It was only natural that customer had an instant reaction to the number they were presented with (i.e. that's enough or that's not enough for me to live on) so we only had one chance to make a good impression.</p>
          <p class="margin-top smaller">The table of assets below also proved to be a huge value point for customers, many of whom had never seen all of their assets in one place.</p>
